  "article": "Discussions revolve around the cyclical destruction of human civilizations, driven by cosmic or environmental catastrophes. One user claims, \"Society gets ‘destroyed’ by cycles because of several reasons and will continue to get destroyed until our planet reaches a certain state of consciousness.\" Others speculate that elites are hoarding knowledge and resources, with one stating, \"They would feel compelled to act, but there’s no meaningful action they could take.\"  \n\nTheories range from solar events to floods, with some asserting that ancient structures like the pyramids were built as survival bunkers. \"The recently discovered machinery underneath the pyramids could have been some sort of large battery to power cryogenics,\" suggests one participant. Others argue that past civilizations were more advanced, with claims like, \"If they pulled energy from Earth and the upper atmosphere Tesla style, what use is petrol?\"  \n\nElites are portrayed as preparing for collapse while concealing the truth. \"Bill Gates is actually a Humanist... determined to dissolve borders and make sure as much ‘viable genetic stock’ remains,\" one post reads. Conspiratorial undertones emerge, with references to \"Jews\" and \"Martians\" influencing events. Despite fatalism, some urge action: \"Either we do our best to become multi-planetary or we preserve knowledge for the next cycle.\" The thread blends apocalyptic dread with distrust of hidden powers.",
