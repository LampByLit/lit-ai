  "headline": "Inanna Worship Sparks Divine Debate  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around the worship of Inanna (Ishtar), the ancient Mesopotamian goddess, with participants debating her divinity, influence, and modern relevance. One user declared, \"Monotheism is a lie designed to sever people from their spiritual senses,\" framing Inanna as a liberator from Abrahamic oppression. Others dismissed her as a \"sex demon,\" with one arguing, \"You are showing hypersexualized female form to satisfy your libido and mistaking that for divinity.\"  \n\nSupporters celebrated her as the \"Queen of Heaven,\" citing historical syncretism with Marian devotion. A hymn praised her as both warrior and lover: \"I am the lion whose roar causes Heaven to tremble... I am the sacred whore who causes virtuous men to tremble with lust.\" Detractors countered that such imagery reflected hedonism, not holiness, with one asserting, \"Your feelings of divinity are not because of your heart, but because of your penis.\"  \n\nThe thread devolved into broader theological clashes, with anti-Abrahamic rhetoric (\"Yahweh is a demon of jealousy\") met by accusations of puritanism. Some sought practical worship guidance, while others mocked the effort as \"fringe socio-political spiritual movement.\" The debate highlighted tensions between spiritual liberation, sexual morality, and the authenticity of revived pagan practices.",
