  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around the worship of Inanna, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess, with participants divided between reverence and rejection. Supporters claimed, \"Monotheism is a lie designed to sever people from their spiritual senses,\" arguing that Inanna represents liberation from Abrahamic traditions. Others dismissed her as a \"sex demon,\" asserting, \"You are worshipping not the divine mother, but a projection of your penis.\" The debate expanded into broader theological conflicts, with one user declaring, \"Yahweh is a demon of jealousy,\" while another countered, \"Your book is not a valid source.\" Accusations of puritanism and hedonism clashed, with detractors labeling Inanna worshipers as \"femboys\" and \"simps,\" while devotees defended her as the \"Queen of Heaven.\" Some sought practical rituals, lamenting, \"There’s nothing to give some idea of rituals,\" while others dismissed the discourse entirely: \"All gods are fake and gay.\" The thread devolved into personal attacks, with one user concluding, \"Your time is so close you’re cutting your own dicks off from lack of patience.\"",
