  "headline": "Inanna Worship Sparks Divine Debate  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around the worship of Inanna, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess, with participants debating her divinity, influence, and modern relevance. Some claimed she was the \"Queen of Heaven,\" arguing that monotheism, particularly Christianity, was a \"psyop\" designed to sever spiritual connections. \"Monotheism is a lie designed to sever people from their spiritual senses,\" one user asserted. Others dismissed her as a \"sex demon,\" accusing followers of conflating lust with divinity. \"You are worshipping a sex demon, not the Divine Mother,\" a critic countered.  \n\nThe debate extended to broader theological conflicts, with some labeling Yahweh a \"demon of jealousy\" and others defending Abrahamic traditions. \"The OT is propaganda against other civilizations,\" one user claimed, while another retorted, \"Your book is not a valid source.\" The thread also featured esoteric rituals, historical revisionism, and personal spiritual experiences, including claims of divine contact. \"I am once again walking among you,\" a user channeling Inanna declared.  \n\nSexuality emerged as a key point of contention, with some celebrating Inannaâ€™s erotic aspects and others condemning them as corrupting. \"To deny the sexual nature of the Queen of Heaven is heresy,\" one argued, while another warned of \"predatory forces.\" The discussion devolved into insults, with critics dismissing the movement as \"faggotry\" and supporters advocating for a revival of pagan opposition to Abrahamic faiths. \"Innanaism must be an ideology of opposition,\" a user proclaimed. The thread highlighted deep divisions over spirituality, gender, and historical interpretation.",
