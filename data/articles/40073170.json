  "headline": "Inanna Worship Sparks Divine Debate  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the worship of Inanna, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess, with participants debating her divinity, influence, and modern relevance. One user declared, \"Monotheism is a lie designed to sever people from their spiritual senses,\" framing Inanna as a champion of spiritual liberation. Others dismissed her as a \"sex demon,\" with one arguing, \"You are showing hypersexualized female form to satisfy your libido and mistaking that for divinity.\" The discourse expanded into broader theological conflicts, with claims that \"Yahweh is a demon of jealousy\" and Christianity is \"propaganda against other civilizations.\" Some advocated for a revival of polytheism, asserting, \"Animism-Polytheism is the best spirituality.\" Meanwhile, skeptics mocked the devotion, with one stating, \"All gods are fake and gay.\" The thread also featured poetic invocations of Inanna, blending eroticism and reverence, while others derided such expressions as \"hedonism.\" The debate highlighted deep ideological rifts, blending conspiracy, spirituality, and hostility toward Abrahamic traditions.",
