  "article": "A heated debate erupted over the origins and purpose of the Great Pyramid of Giza, with claims ranging from ancient alien technology to lost civilizations. One user asserted, \"Egypt is Atlantis. Another name of Atlantis is Ethiopia,\" citing obscure texts. Others dismissed this, arguing Atlantis was in the Azores, with one stating, \"The Azores plateau fits Platoâ€™s descriptions much better.\" Some proposed the pyramid was a power plant, with one insisting, \"Pyramids are ancient power plants. They provided Free Energy to the people.\"  \n\nRacial and nationalist rhetoric surfaced, with one commenter declaring, \"Egypt was a White Men colony at that time,\" while another countered, \"3rd worlders in general are pest and blight upon this world.\" Some speculated about hidden structures beneath the pyramid, though skeptics dismissed scans as misinterpreted data. One user warned, \"They alter the timeline whenever we find out about them,\" suggesting a grand cover-up.  \n\nThe discussion spiraled into fringe theories, including hollow earth claims and cyclical cataclysms, with one remarking, \"Earth is round and hollow, and it changes magnetic dispositions each 6000 years.\" Despite attempts to debunk wild claims, the thread remained entrenched in conspiratorial thinking.",
