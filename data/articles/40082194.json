  "headline": "Ancient Pyramids and Atlantis Theories Clash  ",
  "article": "A heated debate erupted over the origins of the Great Pyramid of Giza, with claims ranging from ancient alien technology to lost civilizations like Atlantis. One user insisted, \"Egypt is Atlantis. Another name of Atlantis is Ethiopia,\" citing obscure texts. Others dismissed this, arguing Atlantis was in the Azores, with one stating, \"the azores plateau is in the place Plato described.\" Conspiracy theories abounded, including claims of suppressed discoveries: \"the US military hides pyramids in North America.\" Some speculated the pyramids were power plants, with one asserting, \"Pyramids are ancient power plants.\" Racial undertones surfaced, with derogatory remarks about modern Egyptians and assertions that \"ancient white engineers\" built the structures. Skeptics dismissed the theories, with one bluntly stating, \"Itâ€™s a fucking pile of garbage.\" The discussion devolved into arguments over historical fabrication, with a user declaring, \"the Vatican fabricated 1000 years of history.\" Despite attempts to cite research, the thread remained dominated by wild speculation and hostility.",
