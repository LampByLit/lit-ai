  "headline": "Ancient Pyramid Theories Spark Debate  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the origins and purpose of ancient structures, particularly the pyramids of Egypt. One user claimed, \"Egypt is Atlantis,\" citing René Guénon’s writings, while another insisted Atlantis was located in the Atlantic Ocean, stating, \"This is common knowledge among anyone who has a brain.\" Some speculated the pyramids were power plants, with one arguing, \"Pyramids are ancient power plants,\" while others dismissed such claims as baseless.  \n\nConspiracy theories abounded, including claims of hidden alien cities beneath the pyramids and references to \"nephilim-led\" civilizations. Racial undertones emerged, with one commenter asserting, \"thirdworld savages could not and should not have independence for their own good.\" Others debated the technological capabilities of ancient peoples, with one remarking, \"They were probably built by a civilization more advanced than our own.\"  \n\nSkeptics dismissed the discussion as distraction tactics, with one noting, \"People are learning about the Millennial reign too fast.\" The thread devolved into personal attacks, pseudoscience, and references to fringe figures like Graham Hancock and Alex Jones. Ultimately, no consensus was reached, leaving the mysteries of the pyramids—and Atlantis—unresolved.",
