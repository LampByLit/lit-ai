  "article": "A heated debate erupted over a NASA Mars rover image allegedly showing a \"Tic-Tac\"-shaped UFO, sparking accusations of censorship and conspiracy. One user claimed, \"Reddit deletes any and all post on this,\" while another insisted, \"NASA is posting hoaxed pictures.\" Skeptics dismissed it as a \"tiny rock,\" but others countered, \"Why did NASA take it down???\" Some speculated extraterrestrial origins, with one stating, \"It’s reflective like my dick in moonlight.\" Meanwhile, flat-Earth proponents derailed discussions, declaring, \"Space is fake and gay.\" The thread devolved into accusations of government suppression, with claims of \"glowies working around the clock\" to debunk the image. Despite NASA’s archive link still hosting the photo, suspicions persisted, fueled by erratic moderation and alleged data removal. One user summarized the chaos: \"This must be one of the most schizophrenic events that have happened in 2025.\"",
