  "article": "A NASA Mars rover image showing a small, tic-tac-shaped object has ignited intense debate, with claims of censorship and government cover-ups. Users allege the original high-resolution image was removed from NASA’s website, with one stating, \"Reddit deletes any and all posts on this.\" Others insist the object is extraterrestrial, citing its reflective surface: \"The tictac is reflective like my dick in moonlight.\" Skeptics dismiss it as a rock, but suspicions persist due to alleged suppression efforts. \"Glowies working around the clock to debunk this,\" one user wrote. Some even claim NASA faked the image as a \"silent alarm\" to monitor public scrutiny. The discussion spiraled into broader conspiracies, including flat-earth theories and accusations of \"well-poisoning\" by disinformation agents. Meanwhile, conflicting reports about the object’s size—ranging from millimeters to SUV-scale—further fueled confusion. \"Why did NASA take it down???\" remains a recurring question, with no definitive resolution.",
