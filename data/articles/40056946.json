  "headline": "Magnet Experiments and Paranormal Claims  ",
  "article": "A discussion centered on experiments with magnets placed near the pineal gland, claiming enhanced spiritual and cognitive effects. Users debated the proper polarity, strength, and placement, citing Walter Rawls' book *Magnetism and Its Effects on Living Beings*. Some reported vivid dreams, reduced anxiety, and even visions, while others dismissed the claims as pseudoscience. One user stated, \"I had crazy dreams. Then the brain appears to get used to the magnet.\" Others warned of potential dangers, with one cautioning, \"Do not go over 5000G. They found positive effects on magnets starting from 300G to 3500G.\" Conspiracy theories emerged, linking ancient horned gods and Jewish tefillin to magnetic rituals. Skeptics questioned the methodology, with one remarking, \"Complete bullshit.\" Despite skepticism, some vowed to continue testing, with one declaring, \"Gonna try this. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, OP.\" The thread blended fringe science, esoteric beliefs, and personal anecdotes.",
