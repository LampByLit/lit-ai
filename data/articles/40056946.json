  "article": "A discussion centered on experiments involving magnets placed near the pineal gland, with claims of heightened spiritual awareness, vivid dreams, and even paranormal encounters. One user referenced Walter Rawls' book *\"Magnetism and Its Effects on Living Beings,\"* detailing experiments where subjects allegedly saw apparitions after prolonged exposure to magnetic fields. \"I already have results. The most common results are very vivid dreams,\" one participant reported. Others debated magnet polarity, with some asserting that the North pole induces calmness while the South pole increases aggression and physical vitality.  \n\nConspiracy theories emerged, linking ancient horned deities and Jewish tefillin to hidden magnetic rituals. \"Wait, is THAT why jews have that cube on their heads?\" one user speculated. Skeptics dismissed the claims as pseudoscience, while enthusiasts shared DIY methods, including stacking neodymium magnets and measuring Gauss strength. \"I’m feeling stupid now. The magnets move by themselves to the north pole,\" one admitted after misaligning polarity.  \n\nWarnings surfaced about potential dangers, with one user cautioning, \"Don’t go much over [5000 Gauss] since he says it becomes counterproductive.\" Despite risks, some vowed to continue testing, including placing magnets at the base of the skull and spine for alleged energy alignment. \"My whole body is 'buzzing' and everything I see the colors are like 10x brighter,\" one claimed. The thread blended fringe science, esoteric lore, and personal experimentation, reflecting deep-seated fascination with magnetism’s unseen influence.",
