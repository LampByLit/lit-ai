  "headline": "Magnet Experiments Alter Consciousness  ",
  "article": "A discussion centered on experiments with magnets placed near the pineal gland to induce altered states, vivid dreams, and even spiritual encounters. One user cited Walter Rawls' book *Magnetism and Its Effects on Living Beings*, claiming that exposing the forehead to a magnet's north pole (1,000â€“5,000 Gauss) could trigger visions: *\"During the third week wearing the mask, the room around Rawls dissipated entirely, leaving him looking at a hillside with two people sitting under a tree.\"* Others reported intense dreams and third-eye pressure, with one noting, *\"I feel profound inner peace when the magnet is on my Third Eye.\"*  \n\nPolarity debates emerged, with some suggesting the south pole enhances aggression and physicality, while the north pole fosters calmness. One warned, *\"S pole makes animals grow strong but dumb; N pole makes them weak but smart.\"* Skeptics dismissed the claims, but multiple users experimented, sharing methods like stacking disc magnets or using headbands. Risks were debated, with concerns over excessive magnetism causing cognitive harm. A fringe theory linked ancient horned gods and Jewish tefillin to magnetic rituals, speculating, *\"The cube on their heads might contain a magnet.\"* Despite mixed results, the thread revealed a blend of curiosity, pseudoscience, and extreme experimentation.",
