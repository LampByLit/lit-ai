  "headline": "Magnet Experiments and Paranormal Claims  ",
  "article": "A discussion centered on experiments with magnets placed near the pineal gland to induce paranormal experiences, including vivid dreams, spiritual visions, and altered states of consciousness. One user cited Walter Rawls' book *Magnetism and Its Effects on Living Beings*, claiming that exposing the forehead to a magnet's north pole (1,000–5,000 Gauss) could trigger ghost sightings. Others shared personal attempts, reporting \"very vivid dreams\" and \"pressure in the third eye.\" Skeptics dismissed the claims as \"complete bullshit,\" while some speculated about historical and religious connections, such as Jewish tefillin possibly mimicking ancient magnetic devices. Concerns about safety arose, with warnings against excessive magnetic exposure leading to \"mutant animals\" or cognitive damage. The thread devolved into debates over magnet strength, polarity, and conspiracy theories about suppressed research. One user warned, \"Don’t go over 5,000 Gauss... it becomes counterproductive.\" Others experimented regardless, with mixed results.",
