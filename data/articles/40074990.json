  "article": "A chaotic discussion unfolded around sex, magic, and bizarre conspiracy theories. One user claimed, \"Sex is fake and gay,\" arguing it’s a global psyop designed to manipulate people into consumerism: \"because you want it so bad it make you gullible and easily controlled.\" Another insisted women don’t have vaginas, stating, \"Vaginas aren’t real. Vulvas aren’t real. Gaps aren’t real,\" alleging female anatomy is a fabricated illusion. Meanwhile, a self-proclaimed practitioner of \"biokinesis\" asserted they were \"using biokinesis to have a new puberty\" for \"dick growth.\" Debates over sexual techniques devolved into arguments about vibrators, with one dismissing them as \"soulless cuck shit,\" while another countered, \"You could never compete with me or my bag of toys.\" Occultist Aleister Crowley’s sex magic practices were hotly contested, with claims he engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual rituals. One user dismissed critics: \"Crowley was a fag but he still fucked many women.\" The thread spiraled further into absurdity, including claims that \"erectile dysfunction was made up by Pfizer.\" Amid the chaos, a rare moment of clarity emerged: \"To be a sex god you have to develop your empathy.\" The discussion remained a mix of crude humor, extreme beliefs, and outright delusion.",
