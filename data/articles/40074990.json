  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around sex, conspiracy theories, and esoteric beliefs. One user claimed, \"sex is fake and gay,\" arguing it is a \"global psyop\" designed to manipulate people into consumerism and obedience. Another insisted, \"Erectile dysfunction was made up by Pfizer to sell heart meds,\" reflecting deep pharmaceutical distrust. Some advocated for unconventional methods, such as \"biokinesis to have a new puberty\" for \"dick growth,\" with one stating, \"I affirm 'I am using biokinesis to have a new puberty.'\" Others debated sex techniques, with conflicting advice like \"Don’t insert your fingers\" versus \"hook your fingers scratch the inside of her hole.\" The conversation took a surreal turn with claims that \"vaginas aren’t real,\" asserting that female anatomy is a fabrication to sustain industries. Aleister Crowley’s sex magik was debated, with one user declaring, \"Crowley was a fag and a passive one at that,\" while another countered that he \"fucked anything that walked.\" Vibrator use sparked division, with one dismissing it as \"soulless cuck shit,\" while another praised it as a \"sexual tool to add to your experience.\" The thread devolved into absurdity, blending misinformation, extreme skepticism, and bizarre sexual theories.",
