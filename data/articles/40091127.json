  "article": "A discussion centered on the origins and interpretations of the \"Aryan race\" revealed deep-seated conspiracy theories, racial myths, and occult influences. One user claimed, \"The Aryan tribe came from a progeny of Japheth son of Noah,\" while another asserted that Aryans were descendants of Atlanteans, stating, \"The Celts are the direct descendants of the Atlanteans.\" Some dismissed Slavs as a legitimate race, calling it a \"Jewish divide and conquer tactic.\"  \n\nNazi ideology was debated extensively, with one participant arguing, \"Hitler was clearly controlled by the Bush-Scherff family,\" while another countered, \"Hitler was based full stop.\" Theosophy and occult influences on Nazism were highlighted, with references to figures like Blavatsky and Steiner, who allegedly shaped Nazi racial theories.  \n\nAlternative history claims included Atlantis being located near Denmark or the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with survivors allegedly repopulating Europe. One user insisted, \"The survivors came down from the Highlands... and were met by Taygetans.\" Others dismissed these ideas as \"schizo larp.\"  \n\nThe thread also featured bizarre extraterrestrial theories, such as, \"blond people are descended from the Pleiadians.\" Throughout, accusations of Jewish manipulation and historical revisionism persisted, reflecting a mix of esoteric beliefs and extremist rhetoric.",
