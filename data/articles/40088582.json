  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around antipsychotic medications, schizophrenia, and spiritual delusions. One user claimed, \"Police lock you up by force in the psych ward, if you decline to take the pills, nurses and security inject you by force,\" expressing distrust in psychiatric institutions. Another described delusions of grandeur: \"Be born god or some messiah figure. The universe is like a dark souls level there is evil lurking in the dark and you are the hero because you are good.\"  \n\nCritics of medication warned of severe side effects: \"Zyprexa almost killed me,\" while others defended treatment: \"Take your meds retards. I work in mental health and I'm tired of dealing with you non compliant fuck ups.\" Some advocated alternative remedies, with one suggesting, \"Ginko Bilbao, it counteracts the meds, my voices came back in 2 days.\"  \n\nSpiritual and conspiratorial themes emerged, with claims like, \"The Bible is the most powerful tool we have. Supernatural gifts are not just stories.\" Others dismissed these beliefs: \"You have schizophrenia dude and its good that the drug worked because now you can experience actual real spiritualism.\" The debate remained polarized, with deep distrust of psychiatry clashing against calls for medical compliance.",
