  "article": "A disturbing collection of paranoid and delusional beliefs emerged in a recent discussion, blending conspiracy theories with graphic personal experiences. One user recounted an alien invasion narrative, claiming, \"they supposedly can liquify your body and keep it in storage units similar to washing machines,\" which left them with an \"overwhelming sense of dread.\" Another insisted the Queen of England shapeshifted, citing a deleted royal family webpage: \"the royal family had a page on their official website apologizing for it which was then subsequently removed from history.\" Extreme gore, including cartel violence and alleged child trafficking, was frequently referenced, with one user recalling a childhood acquaintance appearing on a dark web prostitution site: \"She was older, of course, and had big bags under her eyes... but it was definitely the girl from my town.\" Conspiratorial antisemitism surfaced, with claims that \"the jews control the masses.\" Others lamented the internet’s decline, calling it \"overtaken by subhumans, degenerates, and normies.\" The thread also featured bizarre medical fears, such as unverified claims about euthanasia protocols: \"none of the countries doing assisted dying actually check you’re unconscious while you’re dying.\" The discussion spiraled into apocalyptic and supernatural fears, with one user declaring, \"The horrors that I have experienced in life... pale in comparison to what awaits the vast majority of humanity.\"",
