  "article": "A disturbing collection of experiences and conspiracy theories emerged, ranging from graphic violence to deep-seated paranoia. One user recounted an alien invasion story so vivid it induced \"a sense of impending doom and terror,\" describing how extraterrestials could \"liquify your body and keep it in storage units.\" Another shared a chilling encounter with a childhood friend listed on a dark web prostitution site, lamenting, \"It got brought up in private conversations a few times and even 10 years later the thought that there are those kinds of websites just haunts me.\"  \n\nConspiracy theories abounded, including claims of the Queen of England shapeshifting, with one insisting, \"the royal family had a page on their official website apologizing for it.\" Others alleged an \"elite pedo cabal trafficking and sacrificing children right in front of us,\" while some fixated on Rwandan genocide denial, citing obscure sources.  \n\nGore and psychological horror dominated discussions, with references to cartel torture videos, stillborn photography, and disturbing media like \"One Guy One Jar.\" A pervasive dread of societal decay also surfaced, with one user lamenting, \"The internet is overtaken by subhumans, degenerates, and normies.\"  \n\nReligious fears and AI paranoia crept in, with warnings of Hell and claims that \"a computer engages in more meaningful discourse than humans.\" The thread spiraled into fragmented terror, blending real trauma with unfounded delusions.",
