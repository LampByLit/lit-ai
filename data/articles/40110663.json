  "headline": "Semen Retention Beliefs and Conspiracies  ",
  "article": "The discussion revolves around the practice of semen retention (SR), with participants sharing personal experiences, scientific studies, and extreme beliefs. Some users cite PubMed studies to support claims about testosterone fluctuations and fertility benefits, while others promote spiritual and supernatural effects. One user warns against \"degenerate practices,\" linking pornography and homosexuality to \"demon worshipping,\" stating: \"Are ALL demon worshipping, reddit tier, filth.\" Others describe SR as a path to heightened confidence, with one anon claiming: \"I speak my mind a lot more openly and sincerely after being on SR.\"  \n\nConspiracy theories emerge, including claims of \"demonic interference\" causing social hostility and assertions that historical figures like Tesla and Hitler practiced SR. One user suggests women's attraction fluctuates with moon cycles, while another dismisses critics as \"shills\" and \"probably Indian.\" Wet dreams are debated, with some viewing them as relapses and others experimenting with herbal remedies like Valerian tea. The thread also includes hostility toward online communities, with accusations that \"/tv/ and /v/ are filled with porn-addicted degenerates.\" The discussion blends pseudoscience, spirituality, and paranoia, reflecting a mix of self-improvement zeal and conspiratorial thinking.",
