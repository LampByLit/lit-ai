  "article": "A discussion unfolded around the idea of becoming a \"succ slave,\" with users debating the risks and rewards of such arrangements. One user claimed, \"Definitely depends on the succ, but its gone very well for me~,\" while another warned, \"If you’re not getting your succubi or incubi from Asmodeus or Lilith you’re literally opening yourself up to possession.\" Some speculated that succubi are \"insectoid predators\" implanting eggs in humans, citing bizarre reasoning: \"Succubi are descended from insectoid spirits and want to implant us with their eggs, QED.\" Others dismissed these claims, with one stating, \"They don’t implant eggs in humans... that’s not how spirit reproduction works.\"  \n\nThe thread also featured warnings about \"earthbound or elemental succubi,\" described as \"the most dangerous energetic parasites.\" One user recounted a disturbing dream involving a \"psychopathic spirit\" and a city of enslaved millions, theorizing that \"we’ve attracted this spirit because we keep fantasizing about being slaves to hot demon women.\" Gender identity debates erupted, with some users insisting succubi turn men trans, while others denied it. One participant declared, \"Lilith is freedom. Lilith is liberation,\" while another dismissed the thread as \"ego-fueled bigotry.\" The discussion spiraled into personal attacks and esoteric arguments, blending occult speculation with paranoid delusions.",
