  "headline": "Divine Will and Demonic Intrusions Debated  ",
  "article": "A discussion unfolded around the nature of negative thoughts, divine will, and demonic influence. One participant insisted, \"Demons are real and external,\" attributing intrusive thoughts to malevolent forces: \"a demon feeding me shit or a narcissistic friend.\" Another countered, \"Those are just thoughts,\" though they acknowledged past encounters during psychosis: \"Demons came after me during psychosis. They’re not us.\"  \n\nThe conversation shifted to gnosis and divine alignment, with one user claiming, \"You just have to believe God is omniscient and omnipotent... Once we reach gnosis, knowing, we become the thing.\" Others rejected this, arguing that evil is distinct: \"hate evil & love good, dont try to reconcile polar opposites.\" A dissenter dismissed the idea of God orchestrating suffering: \"no god did not give this child cancer to teach us some lesson.\"  \n\nFree will was fiercely contested. One asserted, \"our will is subject to God’s will,\" while another retorted, \"If he can make everything possible... he can create reality in which he gave souls perfect free will.\" The debate spiraled into theological absolutism, with claims like \"God can’t make mistakes\" clashing with skepticism: \"religion was a mistake.\" The exchange revealed deep divisions over whether suffering reflects divine intent or external corruption.",
