  "headline": "Money as the Root of Evil  ",
  "article": "A heated debate unfolded over whether money is inherently evil or merely a tool corrupted by human greed. One user argued, \"Money is literally the root of all evil,\" while another countered, \"Money is just a symbol of value. So appraising things to have value is the root of evil for you?\" Conspiratorial claims emerged, with one alleging, \"Jews donâ€™t want the goyim to want money, they want you to do as they say not as they do.\" Others linked wealth to systemic oppression, stating, \"The ruling class bankers are the PEOPLE you should be pissed at, not inanimate money.\" Religious interpretations clashed, with one citing scripture: \"The Bible quote actually says that the love of money is the root of all evil.\" Meanwhile, a Marxist perspective insisted, \"Money used as capital is the modern problem.\" The discussion spiraled into accusations of exploitation, with one user declaring, \"You are trespasser and a thief\" for panning gold. Some advocated for alternative systems, proposing, \"We need to replace money with energy,\" while others dismissed such ideas as delusional. The thread devolved into personal attacks, with insults like \"shut the fuck up you mindless money golem\" reflecting deep ideological divides.",
