  "headline": "Money as the Root of Evil  ",
  "article": "A heated debate unfolded over whether money is inherently evil or merely a tool corrupted by human greed. One user argued, \"Money is literally the root of all evil,\" while another countered, \"Money is just a symbol of value. So appraising things to have value is the root of evil for you?\" Some blamed systemic exploitation, with claims like, \"BANKERS, themselves, are the cause of wars,\" echoing conspiratorial distrust of financial elites. Others linked wealth to moral decay, stating, \"The richest man in the world is the most miserable one.\" Religious interpretations surfaced, such as, \"The love of money is the root of all evil,\" alongside accusations that Christianity promotes passivity to maintain control: \"It’s like it’s designed to leave you powerless.\" A fringe view dismissed money entirely, proposing, \"We need to replace money with energy.\" The discussion devolved into personal attacks, with one user branding opponents as \"demonic\" and another retorting, \"You’re a programmed money slave.\" Ultimately, no consensus emerged, reflecting deep ideological divides over wealth, power, and morality.",
