  "article": "A chaotic discussion unfolded, blending conspiracy theories, religious fervor, and violent fantasies. One user claimed, *\"there are sex traffickers that use glowing stone, not witches,\"* suggesting hidden technology like *\"assassins creeds the apple\"* for mind control. Others fixated on witch hunts, declaring, *\"We're killing witches throughout this village,\"* while another warned of *\"black projects and technology they don’t understand.\"* Paranoia extended to systemic oppression, with one lamenting, *\"you’re being systematically denied the opportunity to earn money.\"* Delusions of divine purpose surfaced, such as *\"I fused my spirit with God’s will. I am his hand.\"* Meanwhile, erratic YouTube links and disjointed rants about *\"Ultra Instinct Gooning Enoch God-Fusion\"* underscored the thread’s instability. Some dismissed the hysteria, retorting, *\"your totally delusional,\"* but the prevailing tone was one of unhinged suspicion and grandiosity.",
