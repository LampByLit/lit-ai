  "article": "A series of tarot readings exposed widespread personal anxieties, with users seeking guidance on love, finances, and existential fears. Many expressed desperation, asking, \"Will things turn around for me soon or should I just KMS?\" Others fixated on romantic validation: \"Does he like me? Is he going to make a move?\" Some delved into paranoia, questioning friendships: \"Did she always like him while we were together?\" Conspiratorial thinking emerged, such as claims of impersonation: \"They are jealous of my ability.\" One user insisted, \"She plans to kill me. I curse her and all her kin.\" Financial instability and job insecurity dominated concerns, with queries like, \"Will I ever get out of debt?\" The thread also featured extreme reliance on divination, with one user asking, \"How do I actively induce sleep paralysis?\" The discussions revealed a pattern of emotional dependency on mystical solutions for life's uncertainties.",
