  "article": "A series of tarot readings exposed widespread personal anxieties, financial distress, and relationship insecurities. Many sought guidance on employment, with one individual asking, \"Will I get more hrs at my job or should I look for a second one?\" while another lamented, \"I’m really struggling financially... should I just KMS?\" Romantic uncertainties dominated, with questions like, \"does he like me? is he going to make a move on me\" and \"Will he come back to be with me?\" Some responses were bleak, such as, \"Some K-drama business going on here, there’s tragedy there’s love and there’s a shit ton of drama.\" Others fixated on supernatural concerns, including, \"What should I be wary of if I choose to talk to King Asmodeus?\" The readings often reinforced fatalistic thinking, with one reply stating, \"Happy, content and easy. They will feel like they could be themselves with you,\" while another warned of a \"nest of snakes\" workplace. The pervasive reliance on tarot for major life decisions highlights deep-seated fears and a search for external validation.",
