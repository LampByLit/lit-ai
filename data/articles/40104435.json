  "article": "A heated discussion revolves around alleged underground structures beneath the Egyptian pyramids, sparking wild speculation and conspiracy theories. Some dismiss the claims outright, calling them a \"nothingburger\" or a scam, with one user stating, \"most likely is they simply invented a load of fake shit.\" Others propose elaborate doomsday scenarios, such as a \"massive stone machine\" that resets human civilization every 12,000 years, triggered by discovery: \"Once humanity evolves just enough to finally figure out exactly what it is, it’s already too late.\"  \n\nSkepticism abounds, with accusations that Egyptian authorities suppress research for financial gain: \"They know that its a one shot, once nothing of interest is discovered then that’s the end of the gravy train.\" Some link the theories to ancient myths, citing the Atrahasis Epic as evidence of humanity’s creation as slave labor by extraterrestrial beings.  \n\nMeanwhile, flat-earth proponents hijack the thread, declaring, \"space is fake and gay,\" and sharing links to fringe resources. Others mock the discussion, joking about \"giant obelisks created by giant humans\" or warning against opening \"stairways\" that trap a hidden \"monster.\" The debate devolves into insults, with users calling each other \"retard faggots\" and dismissing opposing views as \"CIA psyops.\" Amid the chaos, no consensus emerges—only a mix of paranoia, humor, and hostility.",
