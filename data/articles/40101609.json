  "article": "The discussion revolves around extreme beliefs in the Law of Assumption (LOA), where participants claim to manipulate reality through visualization and mental exercises. One user insists, \"You can even make everyone in the world billionaires, solve world hunger, end all wars,\" while another questions, \"How do I manifest an entire city getting erased from the face of earth?\" Some express grandiose delusions, such as a participant who states, \"I think nevillie had the right idea... but he probably realized this power was too much so he faggoted out.\" Others engage in paranoid speculation, with one asking, \"What if all the negative people ITT are manifestations of the doubts of my subconscious mind?\"  \n\nThe thread also includes disturbing desires, like a user inquiring, \"If i wanted someone to commit suicide they can just demanifest it or what?\" alongside hostile exchanges, such as, \"you are very ugly and rotten inside, which is why this shit doesn’t work for you bro.\" Some claim personal success, asserting, \"Things are wonderful. My family easily helps everyone in need now and receives endless abundance in return,\" while others express despair: \"I’m going to kill myself my life is so pathetic.\" The discussion devolves into conspiratorial thinking, with one user declaring, \"NPC will end themselves with no value lost.\"  \n\nOverall, the thread blends delusional grandiosity, paranoia, and interpersonal hostility, reflecting extreme and unstable belief systems.",
