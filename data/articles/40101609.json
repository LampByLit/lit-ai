  "article": "A discussion centered around the Law of Attraction (LOA) and manifestation techniques spiraled into extreme beliefs, paranoia, and delusional thought patterns. One user claimed, \"I think Neville had the right idea about the feeling of it being done and assumptions hardening into real world events but he probably realized this power was too much so he faggoted out and made some self imposed limiting beliefs.\" Others debated whether they could manifest mass suicides, with one stating, \"NPC will end themselves with no value lost and actual people will either resist and keep living or too weak to make world better place anyway.\"  \n\nSome participants insisted on their ability to alter reality, with one asking, \"How do i manifest an entire city getting erased from the face of earth?\" while another boasted, \"Before covid i spent some yesr saying id spread a virus trough china.\" Others fixated on personal relationships, with one distressed user lamenting, \"Iâ€™m going to kill myself my life is so pathetic,\" after failing to manifest a romantic connection.  \n\nThe thread also featured bizarre claims of reality manipulation, including a user who asserted, \"If you believe that they can reject it - they can. If you believe they can't - they can't.\" Hostility and personal attacks were frequent, with one participant declaring, \"you are very ugly and rotten inside, which is why this shit doesn't work for you bro.\" The discussion devolved into schizophrenic musings, with one user questioning, \"What if all the negative people ITT are manifestations of the doubts of my subconscious mind?\"  \n\nDespite occasional attempts at rational discourse, the thread remained dominated by extreme beliefs, conspiracy theories, and emotional instability.",
