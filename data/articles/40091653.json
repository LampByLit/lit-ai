  "headline": "Flat Earth Debate Spirals into Conspiracies  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion on the shape of the Earth devolved into conspiracy theories, personal attacks, and pseudoscientific claims. Some users insisted the Earth is flat, citing shadows on clouds as proof: *\"Flat Earth Fact #16 - No Earth Curve Shadow Proves Earth is Flat.\"* Others dismissed these claims, pointing to the analemma phenomenon: *\"If the sun is local and circling above a flat earth, how come the shape and size of the analemma doesnâ€™t change?\"*  \n\nHollow Earth theories also emerged, with one user stating, *\"Earth is hollow and we live inside it.\"* Meanwhile, accusations of shilling and government deception dominated the thread, with claims like *\"They want to gaslight us into not believing our own senses.\"* Some users linked flat Earth beliefs to religious and antisemitic rhetoric, such as *\"the Jew wants you to see yourself as insignificant.\"*  \n\nA recurring theme was the rejection of mainstream science, with users demanding *\"just rent a boat and sail to [hidden continents].\"* Others countered with evidence from simulations and real-world observations, but the debate remained entrenched in distrust and hostility.",
