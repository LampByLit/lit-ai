  "headline": "Flat Earth Debate Reveals Deep Divisions  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the shape of the Earth, with participants divided between flat Earth theories, hollow Earth claims, and conventional globe models. One user dismissed flat Earth discourse as irrelevant, stating, \"Literal pedos run politics and these guys keep talking about the shape of the earth?\" Others insisted on alternative models, with one declaring, \"Earth is hollow and we live inside it.\"  \n\nSkeptics challenged flat Earth proponents, demanding empirical proof: \"Rent a boat and sail around the globe... globe proven.\" Meanwhile, conspiracy theories emerged, with one user alleging, \"They want to gaslight us into not believing our own senses.\"  \n\nA detailed rebuttal using Kerbal Space Program simulations attempted to debunk flat Earth claims, with one user explaining, \"If you plug in the values for the earth, you will get the familiar figure 8 pattern.\" However, flat Earth advocates dismissed such arguments, with one mocking, \"Do you know how retarded you sound?\"  \n\nAntisemitic undertones surfaced, with one commenter blaming \"the jew\" for promoting insignificance. The debate ended unresolved, with flat Earth believers clinging to unverified claims while critics demanded verifiable evidence.",
