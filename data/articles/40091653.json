  "headline": "Flat Earth Debate Rages On  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the shape of the Earth, with participants fiercely divided between flat Earth, globe, and hollow Earth theories. One user dismissed flat Earth as irrelevant, stating, \"Literal pedos run politics and these guys keep talking about the shape of the earth?\" Others insisted on a flat plane, with one declaring, \"Earth is hollow and we live inside it.\" Some accused flat Earthers of attention-seeking, while others defended their beliefs, claiming, \"They want to gaslight us into not believing our own senses.\"  \n\nA lengthy debate ensued over shadows, flight paths, and celestial mechanics. One user attempted to debunk flat Earth claims by simulating planetary motion in Kerbal Space Program, stating, \"If you plug in the values for the earth you will get the familiar figure 8 pattern.\" Conspiracy theories abounded, with accusations of shilling and government deception: \"They want to waste your life with false narratives.\"  \n\nReligious and antisemitic rhetoric also surfaced, with one commenter asserting, \"The Jew wants you to see yourself as insignificant.\" Others dismissed flat Earth entirely, demanding, \"Prove its there. Also, learn about the magnetic field.\" The thread devolved into personal attacks, with one user mocking a critic as a \"crossdressing edomite.\" Despite attempts at scientific discourse, the discussion remained entrenched in hostility and unverified claims.",
