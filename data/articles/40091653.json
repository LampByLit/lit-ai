  "headline": "Flat Earth Debate Reveals Deep Divisions  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the shape of the Earth, with participants fiercely divided between flat Earth beliefs, hollow Earth theories, and conventional globe models. One user dismissed flat Earth discourse as irrelevant, stating, \"Literal pedos run politics and these guys keep talking about the shape of the earth?\" Others insisted on conspiracy, with claims like \"They want to gaslight us into not believing our own senses.\"  \n\nHollow Earth theories also surfaced, with one user asserting, \"Earth is hollow and we live inside it,\" while another countered with seismic evidence: \"Earthquakes in California can be detected in China—non-hollow globe proven.\" Skeptics challenged flat Earth proponents to provide a functional map, mocking their inability to do so.  \n\nA detailed rebuttal using Kerbal Space Program simulations attempted to debunk flat Earth claims, demonstrating the solar analemma’s figure-8 pattern as proof of a spherical Earth. Critics dismissed these efforts, with one flat Earther declaring, \"Globerfers on suicide watch, looks flat.\" Conspiratorial accusations flew, including claims that NASA’s imagery is fabricated and that \"Freemasons admitting it\" proves deception.  \n\nThe debate spiraled into personal attacks, with one user labeling opponents as \"bored liars with empty lives.\" Despite attempts at rational discourse, many participants clung to entrenched beliefs, illustrating the deep polarization surrounding the topic.",
