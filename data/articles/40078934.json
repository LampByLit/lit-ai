  "article": "A former Boeing employee described bizarre, seemingly supernatural experiences while working in a high-security facility. The individual recounted an incident where time appeared to freeze, accompanied by a \"golden light\" entity that accused them of \"cheating\" after they rolled a die. Coworkers allegedly reacted as if this were a test, leaving the poster bewildered. Other events included precognitive visions, such as foreseeing a flood after seeing spectral black birds, and encountering doppelgängers of family members. The poster speculated these phenomena were tied to the facility’s secretive environment, suggesting reality itself may have been destabilized. Skeptics dismissed the claims as fabrication, while others theorized about dimensional experiments or corporate mind-control programs. The poster insisted the experiences ceased after leaving the company, leaving the incidents unexplained.",
