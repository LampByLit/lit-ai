  "headline": "Gangstalking Claims and Psychological Abuse  ",
  "article": "Discussions revolve around the concept of \"gangstalking,\" a phenomenon where individuals believe they are systematically harassed by coordinated groups, often linked to government agencies or secret organizations. Alleged tactics include surveillance, sleep deprivation, gaslighting, and \"street theater\"â€”strangers performing scripted actions to provoke psychological distress. Some claim electronic harassment through directed sound or hacking, while others describe physical intrusions, drugging, and staged confrontations. Skeptics dismiss these accounts as paranoid delusions or symptoms of mental illness, pointing to inconsistencies and lack of evidence. The debate intensifies with accusations of disinformation campaigns and dismissive labeling of victims as \"schizophrenic.\" Historical references to Stasi tactics and MK-Ultra are cited to legitimize claims, though mainstream sources often attribute such experiences to psychological conditions rather than organized persecution. The discourse reflects deep distrust in institutions and a clash between lived experiences and clinical explanations.",
