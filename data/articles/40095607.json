  "article": "A heated discussion reveals deep-seated paranoid and delusional beliefs surrounding \"gangstalking,\" a conspiracy theory alleging coordinated harassment by government agencies or secret groups. Users describe tactics such as \"street theatre,\" where strangers allegedly perform scripted actions to provoke psychological distress. One post claims, \"Mass strangers doing things in public to annoy targets... causing great psychological trauma.\" Others detail electronic harassment, sleep deprivation, and \"V2K\" (Voice-to-Skull) technology, insisting these methods are used to discredit victims by framing them as mentally ill. Skeptics dismiss the claims, with one user mocking, \"Face it, most agents will be infinitely more successful than any of you sad virgins.\" However, believers counter with personal anecdotes, such as waking up bruised or finding objects mysteriously moved. The thread devolves into insults, with accusations of schizophrenia and gaslighting. One user asserts, \"They’re human torturers, psychological abusers,\" while another retorts, \"gangstalking isn’t real, meds now.\" The debate highlights extreme paranoia, with some users insisting on a global conspiracy, while others ridicule the claims as delusional.",
