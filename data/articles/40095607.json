  "article": "A heated discussion revolves around the concept of \"gangstalking,\" with participants detailing alleged harassment tactics they claim to experience. One user describes methods like \"street theatre,\" where strangers supposedly mimic private conversations or reference media the target recently consumed: \"When you are walking around and people start repeating conversations you have had with other people face to face, on the phone or even through email word for word then you know it is street theatre.\" Others list extensive harassment techniques, including surveillance, sleep deprivation, and \"V2K\" (Voice-to-Skull) technology: \"The use of directional speakers which have the ability to direct sound to a single individual in a crowded room.\" Skeptics dismiss these claims as paranoid delusions, with one stating, \"Gangstalking is a meme. So-called 'victims' are usually either 1) undiagnosed bipolar/schizophrenic or 2) just plain retarded.\" Some users share personal trauma, such as alleged childhood abuse, while others mock the idea of coordinated harassment: \"Why would someone gangstalk literal nobodies?\" The thread devolves into insults, with believers accusing detractors of being \"glowies\" (government agents) and skeptics labeling proponents as mentally ill. References to historical abuses like Stasi tactics and MKUltra are cited as evidence, but no verifiable proof is provided. The debate highlights a stark divide between those convinced of systemic persecution and those attributing such beliefs to psychological conditions.",
