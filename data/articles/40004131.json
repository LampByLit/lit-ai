  "headline": "Kitsune Worship and Delusional Devotion  ",
  "article": "A fervent discussion revolves around the worship of kitsune (fox spirits), blending folklore, personal delusions, and extreme devotion. One user claims, *\"Any LUNAtics giving the foxes BLOOD during the BLOOD MOON? You will get a special BLOOD red foxwife while supplies last.\"* Others express paranoia about \"anti-fox forces\" suppressing their beliefs, with one declaring, *\"Damn them! They must be the same people killing these threads! And stopping my Fox wife from getting to me!\"* Some threaten violence, stating, *\"I can incinerate their families on camera if anyone moves more than 5 inches.\"*  \n\nA recurring figure is \"Timmy,\" a nickname for Tamamo no Mae, a legendary kitsune. One user insists, *\"Tamamo no Mae is Christ and Christ is King. Also she prefers to be called Timmy.\"* Others mock this belief, with one retorting, *\"She escaped the rock to erase our sins (and then kill us).\"*  \n\nConspiracy theories emerge, including a warning about a Southeast Asian cult grooming men with kitsune promises, leading to prostitution. Skeptics dismiss it, with one replying, *\"I see no negatives here so I will continue. Frankly I see an upside.\"*  \n\nTulpas (imaginary companions) are discussed, with one user sharing, *\"My tulpa temporarily started taking on the form of Fate’s Timmy.\"* Others deride this as delusional, arguing, *\"You tuplafags are the biggest larpers ever, literally making up imaginary friends.\"*  \n\nThe thread devolves into insults, with fox lovers and haters clashing. One user declares, *\"Foxes are always good. They can sense good souls,\"* while another counters, *\"Nothing is 'always' except God. Fxoes don’t like me because I’m a problem for them.\"* The debate remains unresolved, steeped in paranoia and fervent belief.",
