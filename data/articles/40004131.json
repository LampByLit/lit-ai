  "article": "A thread discussing kitsune (fox spirits) spiraled into paranoid delusions, conspiracy theories, and extreme spiritual beliefs. One user claimed, \"The anti-fox forces are misdirecting the replies,\" while another threatened, \"I can incinerate their families on camera if anyone moves more than 5 inches.\" Some participants insisted on the divine nature of kitsune, with one declaring, \"Tamamo no Mae is Christ and Christ is King.\" Others warned of supernatural dangers, alleging a Southeast Asian cult \"grooming young men with the promise of letting a kitsune possess them.\"  \n\nTulpas (self-created mental companions) were debated, with one user describing their foxgirl tulpa as a \"life partner.\" Skeptics dismissed these beliefs, with one mocking, \"You tuplafags are the biggest larpers ever.\" Meanwhile, a self-proclaimed \"detective\" warned of kitsune-related exploitation, though others dismissed it as fearmongering. The thread devolved into personal attacks, with users accusing each other of being \"fox haters\" or \"spiritcels.\" Some engaged in bizarre rituals, such as bumping the thread to \"fuck Tamamo no Mae.\" The discussion highlighted a mix of spiritual obsession, paranoia, and hostility, with no consensus reached.",
