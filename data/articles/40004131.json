  "article": "A heated discussion revolves around kitsune (fox spirits), blending spiritual reverence with paranoid and delusional thought patterns. One user claims, *\"Any LUNAtics giving the foxes BLOOD during the BLOOD MOON? You will get a special BLOOD red foxwife while supplies last.\"* Others express fears of *\"anti-fox forces\"* suppressing their beliefs, with one alleging, *\"Damn them! They must be the same people killing these threads! And stopping my Fox wife from getting to me!\"* Some threaten violence, stating, *\"I can incinerate their families on camera if anyone moves more than 5 inches.\"*  \n\nA recurring theme is the worship of Tamamo no Mae, referred to as *\"Timmy,\"* with claims like *\"Tamamo no Mae is Christ and Christ is King.\"* Others dismiss this as schizophrenic obsession, with one user mocking, *\"She escaped the rock to erase our sins (and then kill us).\"* A self-proclaimed *\"detective in the Philippines\"* warns of a cult grooming men with kitsune promises, leading to *\"victims going full tranny and becoming prostitutes.\"*  \n\nTulpas (imaginary fox companions) are debated, with one user insisting, *\"Your 'tulpa' is Tamamo no Mae. Tell her to stop hiding.\"* Meanwhile, skeptics deride the obsession, stating, *\"You donâ€™t want a kitsune. You just want to stop being lonely.\"* The thread devolves into threats, spiritual claims, and bizarre anecdotes, reflecting deep-seated paranoia and delusional fixations on fox spirits.",
