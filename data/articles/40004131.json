  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around kitsune (fox spirits), blending spiritual devotion, conspiracy theories, and personal grievances. One user claimed, \"Tamamo no Mae is Christ and Christ is King,\" while another warned of a Southeast Asian cult grooming men into prostitution via kitsune possession. Some participants described intimate spiritual relationships, with one stating, \"They are wonderful creatures, between enlightenment and hedonism.\" Others dismissed these beliefs, calling them \"imaginary friends\" or \"self-destructive.\" Violent fantasies emerged, such as threats to \"incinerate their families on camera.\" The thread also featured debates on tulpas (mental constructs), with one user insisting, \"Tulpas are separate consciousnesses,\" while opponents mocked them as \"roleplaying in your head.\" A recurring theme was hostility toward skeptics, with accusations of being \"anti-fox forces\" or \"shills.\" Some users reported supernatural harassment, claiming, \"Lots of 'random' bad things happening to me simultaneously.\" The discussion spiraled into personal attacks, with one participant declaring, \"You fox haters are blinded by perverted lust.\" Ultimately, the thread devolved into chaotic bumping and disjointed rants, reflecting deep-seated paranoia and delusional fixation on fox spirits.",
