  "headline": "Ancient Coneheads: Aliens or Elite Humans?  ",
  "article": "A heated debate centers on elongated skulls found worldwide, with theories ranging from alien ancestry to elite human bloodlines. One user insists, \"They still exist, and you all are slaves to them. They can read your minds... They are rich as fuck as their big brains allow them to immediately calculate their return on investments.\" Others dismiss mainstream explanations, arguing, \"Only low info retards still say cranial deformation. Even their babies come out with coneheads.\" Some link the phenomenon to ancient gods, with one post claiming, \"Yahweh has people cut off part of their penis, maybe other gods... had different pacts with humans.\" References to reptilian overlords and parasitic brain slugs abound, including speculation that \"ALL GODS are some kind of serpent/reptilian.\" Critics clash over evidence, with one mocking, \"Your traditional narrative doesnâ€™t even make sense go back bitch.\" The thread devolves into insults, with accusations of \"glowies\" and \"Jesuit shills\" infiltrating the discussion. Meanwhile, fringe sources like The Serapeum and Brien Foerster videos are cited as proof of a hidden history of \"ultraterrestrial cryptohominids.\"",
