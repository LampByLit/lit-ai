  "headline": "Freemasonry's Dark Allegations Debated  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over the nature of Freemasonry, with accusations ranging from Satanic worship to Jewish subservience. One user claimed, \"They serve Jewish interest; the demiurge like gnosticism is a concept made up by Jews for Jews,\" while another countered, \"No, we serve God. Lucifer is not Satan.\" Some alleged Masonic rituals involve \"sexual vampirization of young children\" for immortality, dubbed the \"Royal Secret,\" though a purported Mason dismissed this as \"fanfics from anti-Masonic websites.\" Others linked Masonic symbols to Babylonian roots, asserting, \"The square and compass comes from Babylon.\" Defenders argued Masonry promotes enlightenment, with one stating, \"Masonry never denounces the teachings of God.\" The debate devolved into personal attacks, with critics labeling Masons \"child-rapering faggots\" and supporters accusing detractors of \"Satanic panic.\" Historical references to Nimrod, Solomon’s Temple, and John Dee’s occult influence were cited as evidence of Masonry’s alleged corruption. Amidst the chaos, a self-identified 32nd-degree Mason insisted, \"We serve Light, not Lucifer.\" The thread underscored deep divisions, blending conspiracy, theology, and vitriol.",
