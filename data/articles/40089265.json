  "headline": "Freemasonry Debated as Demiurge Servants  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded over whether Freemasons serve the demiurge, with accusations of Jewish influence, Satanic allegiance, and occult corruption dominating the debate. One user claimed, \"They serve Jewish interest; the demiurge like gnosticism is a concept made up by Jews for Jews,\" while another countered, \"No, we serve God. Lucifer also is not Satan, that’s a lie.\" References to the alleged Masonic deity \"Jahbulon\" and the \"72 lesser keys of Solomon\" fueled conspiracy theories, with one participant asserting, \"Their power is real through this but it only effects the corrupted.\" Defenders of Freemasonry dismissed these claims as \"fanfics\" and \"anti-Masonic propaganda,\" emphasizing the organization’s focus on enlightenment and moral improvement. However, critics remained adamant, with one stating, \"They worship an inverted conception of Lucifer’s light.\" The debate spiraled into personal attacks, with accusations of child abuse, secret rituals, and historical cover-ups, illustrating deep divisions over the group’s true nature.",
