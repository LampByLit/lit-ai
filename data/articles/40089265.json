  "headline": "Masons Accused of Serving Demiurge  ",
  "article": "A heated debate erupted over whether Freemasons serve the demiurge, with accusations ranging from Jewish subservience to Satanic worship. One user claimed, \"they serve Jewish interest; the demiurge like gnosticism is a concept made up by Jews for Jews,\" while another countered, \"No. They serve Satan.\" Some alleged Masonic rituals involve \"Jahbulon,\" a purported three-headed deity, though a Masonic defender dismissed this as \"anti-Masonic porn.\" Others linked Masonry to ancient Babylonian and Sumerian occultism, asserting, \"They are just unwitting foot soldiers of Jews attempting to power a 3rd temple.\" A self-identified 32nd-degree Mason denied these claims, stating, \"Masons serve Light, and only God and Family are above the Lodge.\" Conspiracy theories persisted, including claims of child sacrifice and immortality rituals, dismissed as \"fanfics\" by Masonic participants. The thread devolved into insults, with one user declaring, \"Freemasonry = Luciferianism = Satanism.\" Despite denials, accusations of Masonic secrecy and corruption dominated the discussion.",
