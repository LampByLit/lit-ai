  "article": "A sprawling discussion reveals deep-seated conspiracy theories about South Korea’s political and social landscape, centering on claims of a secretive matriarchal cult wielding power behind the scenes. The thread alleges that former President Park Geun-hye was controlled by Choi Soon-sil, a shaman tied to the \"8 Goddesses,\" a shadowy network of elite women. \"Park giving away national secrets away to a civilian and extorting corporations to pay her friends,\" one user claims, linking the scandal to radical feminist groups like Megalia, accused of running \"a hate campaign against men\" and promoting abortion extremism.  \n\nThe thread also ties the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster to occult rituals, alleging government cover-ups and suppressed evidence. \"Passengers were ordered to stay where they were as the ship was sinking,\" a commenter asserts, suggesting deliberate sabotage. Other users connect the tragedy to pagan sacrifices, citing dates coinciding with lunar cycles.  \n\nFurther claims implicate K-pop industries in cult activity, with one user stating, \"The Ceo of Jyp is in a religious cult called Salvation Sect.\" The discussion spirals into broader accusations of societal decay, including forced adoptions, military corruption, and high suicide rates. \"South Korea has the fourth highest suicide rate in the world,\" a post notes, framing it as symptomatic of a cursed nation.  \n\nThe thread blends verified scandals with fringe theories, painting South Korea as a dystopia ruled by occult feminism and unchecked corruption. \"It’s a beyond bizarre game of thrones meme country run by witch cults,\" summarizes one participant.",
