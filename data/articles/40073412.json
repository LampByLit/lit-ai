  "article": "A web of conspiracy theories alleges a secretive, female-dominated network controls South Korea, linking political scandals, radical feminism, and occult practices. Former President Park Geun-hye was allegedly manipulated by Choi Soon-sil, a shaman tied to the \"8 Goddesses,\" a shadowy group accused of wielding political influence. \"Park giving away national secrets to a civilian and extorting corporations\" fueled public outrage, leading to her impeachment. Meanwhile, radical feminist groups like Megalia are accused of extreme misandry, with claims they \"push abortion campaigns\" and post \"hundreds of pics of dead, aborted male fetuses.\"  \n\nThe Sewol ferry disaster is tied to these theories, with speculation that Park’s absence and the botched rescue were deliberate. \"Passengers were ordered to stay where they were as the ship was sinking,\" one user noted. Others connect the tragedy to cult rituals, citing its timing near pagan festivals. The Frog Boys murders—unsolved child disappearances—are also invoked, with claims of military cover-ups.  \n\nCults like the Church of Eternal Life and Unification Church (Moonies) are implicated in broader corruption, including K-pop industry ties. \"The CEO of JYP is in a religious cult,\" one post claims. Skeptics dismiss the theories, but believers insist: \"society [is] secretly ruled by matriarchal extremist women.\" The thread weaves paranoia, historical tragedy, and fringe feminism into a dark narrative of hidden power.",
