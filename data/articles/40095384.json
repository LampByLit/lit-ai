  "article": "A discussion centered on semen retention (SR) reveals a mix of personal testimonies, spiritual beliefs, and conspiracy theories. Participants report benefits such as increased confidence, magnetism, and energy, though experiences vary. One user claims, \"Women can’t stop looking at me, but they look like they don’t really know why they want to look at me.\" Others describe SR as a battle against demonic influence, with one warning: \"Demonic intercession tries to get you to coom.\" Religious undertones dominate, with debates over the \"true religion,\" ranging from Catholicism to paganism. Some users link SR to Kabbalistic and Hindu concepts, interpreting it as \"nonviolence\" or \"inner alchemy.\" Skeptics dismiss magnetism claims as placebo, while hardliners insist, \"If you relapse, you lose everything.\" The thread also devolves into misogynistic rants, with one user asserting, \"Women manipulate men by pretending to love them.\" Despite disagreements, the overarching theme is SR as a transformative, quasi-spiritual discipline—though interpretations remain fractured.",
