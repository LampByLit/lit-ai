  "article": "A sprawling discussion reveals a mix of spiritual grandiosity, conspiracy theories, and personal revelations. One user claims, \"Maybe Im an Angel. Maybe im a Demon. Maybe Im Lucifer himself,\" while asserting their role as a \"Lightworker\" spreading love and enlightenment. They describe overcoming schizophrenia, crediting cannabis: \"Weed helped me... I finally enjoy my life.\" However, their beliefs escalate into messianic delusions, declaring, \"I AM Jesus / Lucifer. The same person.\"  \n\nOthers contribute fragmented ideologies, including New World Order prophecies: \"The New World Order will be great and positive. But not for the evil ones.\" A hostile respondent fantasizes about genocidal domination under \"Jesus Christ,\" vowing to replace humanity with \"bioengineered slaves.\" The thread oscillates between camaraderie and paranoia, with users questioning reality: \"What if my Dog isnt real? ... Its real in a way even if its not.\" Music links serve as spiritual anchors, with one user noting, \"Cannabis really lifts you up.\" Amidst chaos, a refrain emerges: \"All you need is LOVE.\" The discussion blends psychosis, conspiracy, and fleeting moments of connection.",
