  "headline": "Manifestation Debate Sparks Conflict  ",
  "article": "A heated discussion unfolded among participants debating the validity and mechanics of manifestation, with some advocating its power while others dismissed it as delusional. Supporters shared personal successes, such as one user who claimed, \"I 'manifested' adding 7 inches to my height,\" while skeptics countered, \"Have you ever seen anyone manifest anything truly impossible?\" The debate escalated into personal attacks, with one detractor labeling believers as \"schizophrenic retards.\" Meanwhile, others experimented with collaborative manifestation, affirming each otherâ€™s desires with phrases like, \"Great things are happening in magnificent ways.\" The thread also explored fringe topics like vampirism and time manipulation, with one user asking, \"Can I manifest physical immortality?\" Amid the chaos, some sought practical advice, such as how to detach from negative assumptions, while others derailed discussions with hostility. The exchange highlighted deep divisions between faith-based belief in manifestation and outright rejection of its principles.",
