  "article": "A series of discussions revolved around divination, curses, and supernatural experiences. Many participants sought tarot readings for personal dilemmas, including love, career, and health. One user shared a vivid nightmare involving demonic entities, interpreted as a spiritual struggle: *\"It wanted me to make a deal with it. It knew if I couldn’t keep the promise it would have my soul.\"* Others debated the ethics of curses, with warnings about potential backfire: *\"Curses can backfire. They’re basically a high school physics class’s project missile launcher.\"* Some users offered protective sigils, while others expressed skepticism. The thread also included paranoid fears, such as AI domination and government surveillance, alongside personal anxieties about relationships and financial instability. The tone fluctuated between earnest belief and dark humor, reflecting a mix of desperation and fascination with the occult.",
