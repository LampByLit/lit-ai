      "headline": "Dostoevsky, Whores, and Nietzschean Justice  ",
      "article": "The discussion centered on Fyodor Dostoevsky’s literary use of prostitutes as tragic figures, with one participant arguing, \"Russians think that being a whore is the utmost sacrifice for women.\" Another countered that Dostoevsky’s philosophy revolves around \"bad people and how they still have feelings and how they can always repent.\" A debate ensued about the romanticization of sex workers, with one quoting Rossetti’s poem \"Jenny\" to illustrate their muse-like role in literature.  \n\nThe conversation shifted to a real-life case involving a wealthy woman who entered pornography as rebellion, prompting arguments about privilege and justice. One user claimed, \"She never had to face the consequences for her life decisions,\" while another dismissed agency debates as \"fabricated concepts to validate man’s base predilection towards cruelty,\" invoking Nietzsche. A lengthy critique of Dostoevsky’s sentimentality emerged, calling his prostitutes \"ghastly\" and \"not to be endured.\" The thread concluded with reflections on art, privilege, and moral condemnation, blending literary analysis with personal grievances.",

            "content": "If you are alluding to Dostoevsky’s worst novels, then, indeed, I dislike intensely The Brothers Karamazov and the ghastly Crime and Punishment rigamarole. No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky’s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity – all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of ”sinning their way to Jesus” or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, ”spilling Jesus all over the place.\" Crime and Punishment’s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked—placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment—by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia’s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.",

      "headline": "Debating Judaism's Influence and Opposition  ",
      "article": "A heated discussion unfolded around Judaism’s historical and theological influence, with participants debating its relationship to Christianity, paganism, and broader Western culture. One user argued that Judaism \"built their religion on top of Paul’s, to be its master,\" while another countered that Christianity and Islam serve as \"protectors of the Jews\" under the \"people of the book\" doctrine. Some advocated for rejecting Abrahamic traditions entirely, proposing instead a return to Hellenistic or pagan frameworks: \"Hadrian destroyed the temple because he was out of their frame. He felt nothing.\"  \n\nCritics of Christianity dismissed it as a \"controlled opposition\" to Judaism, with one asserting that \"Lutherans, Calvinists, and Evangelicals operate as Jewish emissaries.\" Others defended Catholicism, citing its doctrinal authority, while skeptics dismissed Paul’s writings as compromised: \"Paul was Saul, a secret policeman working for the Sadducee and Romans.\"  \n\nReferences to historical conflicts—Hadrian’s destruction of the Second Temple, Nazi antisemitism, and contemporary geopolitics—fueled claims of Jewish resilience and alleged global dominance. One user warned, \"Israel is back, and the Mossad is in everything.\" The debate also touched on philosophical influences, with accusations that Plato and Aristotle \"denatured Greek religion,\" aligning with Jewish thought.  \n\nRecommended readings included Nietzsche’s *The Antichrist* and Skrbina’s *The Jesus Hoax*, though some dismissed such theories as \"insane intellectual neighborhood\" conspiracies. The exchange underscored deep ideological rifts, blending theology, history, and polemics.",

Examples include \"The Cum Also Rises,\" \"Infinite Cum,\" \"The Joy of Cum,\" and \"For Whom the Cum Tolls.\" Some participants extended the trend to political and philosophical works, such as \"The Cum Manifesto\" and \"Foucault’s Cum.\" Others parodied self-help and scientific titles, like \"How to Raise Your I.Q. by Eating Gifted Cum\" and \"The Cum of Species.\" The thread also featured absurd variations like \"Greek Cum Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers\" and \"The Stray Cum Carts of Eastern North America.\" A few users engaged in meta-commentary, with one remarking, \"Best thread on /lit/ in ages,\" while another dismissed it as \"retarded.\" The trend persisted with increasingly niche references, including \"The Cum in the Hat\" and \"The Cum of Monte Cristo,\" showcasing both creativity and absurdity.",

      "article": "The discussion explores the appeal of psychoanalysis, particularly among leftists, with some arguing it serves as a tool for \"rhetorical manipulation\" by pathologizing dissent. One user claims it allows people to \"easily categorize others and control public judgment,\" while another dismisses it as \"schizophrenic\" and \"delusional.\" Critics also link psychoanalysis to feminine reasoning, asserting it aligns with leftist ideology. Meanwhile, defenders argue it provides explanatory power for human behavior, with one stating Freud was \"right on the money\" about repressed desires. The debate extends to political tribalism, with accusations that right-wingers use racism as a substitute for self-hatred, while leftists allegedly weaponize psychoanalysis to delegitimize opponents. References to figures like Lacan, Marx, and Dale Carnegie appear, alongside broader critiques of determinism and free will. The thread devolves into partisan disputes over race, with one user claiming black voters reject Republicans due to policy differences, while another dismisses such arguments as \"mental gymnastics.\" Throughout, psychoanalysis remains polarizing—seen either as profound insight or pseudoscientific manipulation.",

      "article": "The discussion critiques the erosion of intellectual conservatism, attributing its decline to political opportunism, cultural shifts, and ideological incoherence. One user argues, \"Intellectual conservatism is an oxymoron. 'Conservatism' is simply being a reactionary and then coming up with retarded reasons to justify how you feel.\" Others trace its downfall to historical failures, such as the Great Depression, where conservative policies were \"wrong about every single aspect.\" The rise of populist figures like Trump is seen as a rejection of intellectualism: \"They discovered smart people don’t fall for 'never tax the billionaires because of reasons' and that it’s easier to just pander to retards.\"  \n\nReferences to figures like William F. Buckley and Ben Shapiro highlight a perceived shift from reasoned debate to reactionary rhetoric. One comment laments, \"Nobody will waste time reading Saul Bellow when they can get their fix of cheap culture war slop from Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson.\" The thread also explores broader themes of ideological decay, with one user noting, \"If power is your endgoal, and not the health of the country... then Clintonism is terrifying.\" The consensus suggests intellectual conservatism has been supplanted by performative outrage and anti-intellectualism.",

            "content": "I don’t know how I feel about learning that many exceptional men throughout history didn’t marry until they were quite old or didn’t marry at all. On one hand, this gives me the impression that there’s nothing wrong with me for not having a wife and kids at my age. On another hand, these men I’m thinking of, as I mentioned, were exceptional and placed far greater importance on their respective crafts than chasing pussy. <br><br>A documentary I watched on T.S. Eliot alluded that he may have been a virgin until he met and married his first wife at 27. I was kind of shocked to learn that considering that Eliot was a handsome guy in his youth with intelligence and personality to boot. And I was more shocked to learn that his marriage with his first wife was a complete disaster so much so that he completely ignored her for years, but, as far as I know, didn’t form relationships with other women until his wife passed away. <br><br>I read somewhere that romantic love--the kind of love that you’d see in movies--is a western invention that falls into the domain of religiosity and the divine. In a place like India, romantic love as we know it, doesn’t exist in human relationships. It exists in the temple where it can be properly contained. The love that an Indian couple has for one another is a more grounded, human kind of love that accepts the imperfections of one another.<br><br>So it seems to me that all of these exceptional men contained their divine love or anima within things like religion, poetry, music, painting, etc. and kept whatever human relationships they formed were grounded on the human plane. The advice then to love yourself first appears very misleading, even dangerous to a particular set of people. It’s no coincidence that people feel the way they do about relationships today when people are hardly encouraged--especially men--to contain their romantic love within artistic pursuits or religion.",

The synopsis—featuring a 1930s detective plot involving \"counterspies, swing musicians, and outlaw motorcyclists\"—drew mixed reactions. Some praised Pynchon's return after 12 years, while others dismissed it as formulaic: \"30 bucks for a 400-page novel about how racism is le bad,\" scoffed one commenter. Skepticism about the book's authenticity arose, with one user demanding an \"official link\" before believing it. Others debated the $30 price tag, with speculation that a cheaper paperback would follow. The novel's length (384 pages) disappointed fans hoping for a \"doorstopper,\" though some defended Pynchon's ability to deliver depth regardless. Themes of paranoia and historical allegory were hotly contested, with one reader arguing Pynchon’s work \"uncovers the deep state.\" Detractors called his style \"goofy\" and \"pretentious,\" while defenders cited *The Crying of Lot 49* as a masterpiece. The thread also veered into literary influence debates, comparing Pynchon to Joyce, Burroughs, and Nabokov. Amidst the chaos, a user quipped, \"Epic news. Funnily enough, I was thinking the other day about how you guys will cope if Pynchie has Stephen King-tier TDS.\" The discussion closed with memes, existential musings, and a rare consensus: excitement for October’s release.",

One user reflects on unrequited longing: *\"there is no sweetness / in watching death-less / stars at night, knowing / full well i'm wasting time / thinking about you.\"* Another critiques modern poetry’s reliance on line breaks, arguing it forces an artificial \"poem-brain\" mode of reading. Debates over rhyme and meter emerge, with references to historical figures like Thomas Wyatt and Ezra Pound. A recurring theme is the tension between traditional forms and free verse, exemplified by one user’s dismissal of non-rhyming poetry as \"retardation.\"  \n\nThe conversation shifts to frustrations with the poetry publishing industry, lamenting gatekeeping and漫长的 wait times for submissions. One user rails against the system’s inefficiency and bias toward \"marginalized voices,\" while others share self-publishing struggles. Amidst this, playful verses persist, including a sci-fi ballad about \"Glagi Glumpop\" and a darkly humorous rodeo poem. The thread closes with a mix of despair and defiance, capturing the duality of poetic expression—both a refuge and a battleground.",

Nietzsche: Everything sucks, and that’s a good thing!\" Meanwhile, detractors label Nietzsche a \"sophist\" and compare him to Ayn Rand, while supporters defend his critiques of Christianity and determinism. The thread devolves into accusations of bad-faith readings, with one user concluding: \"Nietzsche was a philosemite. That’s a fact.\"",

      "article": "A heated discussion erupted over the declining quality of published works, with one user lamenting, \"Brandon Sanderson is pumping pure unfiltered slop and is getting published.\" Critics argued that modern publishing prioritizes profit over merit, listing criteria like \"name recognition,\" \"BookTok virality,\" and \"celebrity authors\" as driving forces. One commenter summarized the sentiment: \"Publishers don’t want high-quality literature. They want more of the same slop that sells by the bucket.\" Others mocked literary agents' wishlists, parodying demands for \"feminist rewrites\" and \"diverse but not culturally appropriative\" content.  \n\nAmidst the cynicism, aspiring writers shared struggles with traditional publishing’s biases. \"If it isn’t about a woman and feminism, they don’t want it,\" one user vented, while another resigned to self-publishing: \"My books are good, but tradpub threw men under the bus.\" The thread also featured writing excerpts, with mixed feedback. One critique noted, \"The prose is passable but boring,\" while another advised, \"Make the content or prose interesting—mundane musings won’t cut it.\"  \n\nDerailments included debates over grammar, trolling accusations, and meta-complaints about thread quality. A recurring theme was frustration with gatekeeping and market trends, culminating in a sardonic call to \"abandon capitalism for state-mandated reading.\" The discussion underscored a broader disillusionment with literary commercialization and creative constraints.",

One user criticized Christian education, claiming it censors knowledge of the Phoenician alphabet's origins: \"Why don’t most people know this? Because the idea that Canaanite pagans helped lay the foundations of our culture goes against what 'Der Berble' says.\" Others dismissed this, arguing such facts are common knowledge: \"Everyone with basic understanding of historical linguistics knows that.\"  \n\nTheological debates erupted, with some defending Christianity’s moral framework: \"With no god there is no objective morality,\" while opponents countered: \"Morals are based on actions that cause harm.\" Jewish influence was another flashpoint, with one user asserting, \"Jews are malignant puppets animated by dark occult forces to destroy,\" while another cautioned against blanket condemnation.  \n\nMusic and art were invoked as evidence of Christianity’s cultural contributions: \"The existence of Bach and his music makes Christianity a good thing.\" Skeptics dismissed this as irrelevant: \"Bach fucking sucks.\" The thread devolved into personal attacks, with accusations of \"redditor atheism\" and \"Christcuck\" mentalities. Ultimately, the discussion highlighted deep divisions over religion’s role in history, morality, and identity.",

Translation challenges ranged from simple (\"Shepherds tend to their flocks\") to complex pastoral descriptions. Advanced learners debated abstract vocabulary comprehension, with advice to \"Read more\" and use quality dictionaries.
