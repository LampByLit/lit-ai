# Cursor Rules for pol-ai project

# Path Handling
- Always use path.resolve() for absolute paths instead of path.join()
- Never hardcode Unix-style paths (/data) in environment files
- Always use process.cwd() as the base for project root

# Next.js API Routes
- Prefer simple, specific routes over dynamic routes when possible
- Always use NextRequest and NextResponse types for API routes
- Never use the generic Request type in route handlers

# Type Safety
- No 'any' types allowed - use 'unknown' with type guards instead
- Handle all error cases with proper typing
- Remove unused variables to prevent ESLint errors

# Environment Variables
- Keep .env.local simple and development-focused
- Let Railway handle production environment variables
- Never mix development and production settings in the same env file

# Deployment
- Test all file system operations with both Windows and Unix paths
- Ensure all API routes return proper JSON responses
- Keep route handlers simple and focused
